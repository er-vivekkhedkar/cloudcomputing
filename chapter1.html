                <p>1.Client-Server and Collaborative Computing: Historically, computing relied on centralized servers
                    where
                    clients (end-user devices) interacted with these servers to access applications and data.
                    <br>Cloud collaboration is a method of collaboration where multiple individuals may access, review
                    and
                    edit a document in real time <br>2.Cloud Computing: Cloud computing extends this model by providing
                    on-demand access to a shared
                    pool of computing resources (like networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) over the
                    internet. Users can access these resources without needing to manage or own them directly.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Defining cloud Computing : </h2>
                <p>1. Cloud computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the
                    hardware and system software in the datacenters that provide those services.</p>
                <p>2.Cloud computing is an Internet-based computing method. In this way,
                    shared hardware and software resources and information can be provided to computers and other
                    devices on
                    demand.<br>ex. just like water and electricity for everyday use,
                    paid for on demand, without caring about their source</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2> Essential characteristics of cloud computing :</h2>
                <p style="word-wrap: normal; font-size: 18px;">• No Up-front Commitments: <br>
                    Cloud computing allows users to avoid significant initial investments in hardware and
                    infrastructure.
                    Instead, they can pay for resources as they use them, often on a pay-as-you-go or subscription
                    basis.
                    <br>• On-demand Access:<br>

                    Cloud resources can be provisioned and released quickly and easily based on demand. This capability
                    enables businesses to scale resources up or down rapidly in response to changing needs.
                    <br> • Flexible Pricing Models:<br>

                    Cloud providers offer various pricing models, such as pay-as-you-go, subscription-based, or spot
                    instances, allowing organizations to choose the most cost-effective option based on their usage
                    patterns
                    and budget.
                    <br>• Simplified Application Acceleration and Scalability:<br>

                    Cloud platforms provide tools and services that simplify the process of accelerating application
                    development and scaling applications horizontally or vertically to meet demand spikes efficiently.
                    <br>• Efficient Resource Allocation:<br>

                    Cloud computing optimizes resource allocation by dynamically distributing workloads across servers
                    and
                    data centers. This approach ensures that resources are utilized efficiently, minimizing waste and
                    maximizing performance.
                    <br> • Energy Efficiency:<br>

                    Cloud providers design data centers and infrastructure to maximize energy efficiency. Techniques
                    such as
                    virtualization, server consolidation, and efficient cooling systems contribute to reducing energy
                    consumption and environmental impact.
                    <br>• Seamless Integration of Third-Party Services:<br>

                    Cloud environments facilitate easy integration and use of third-party services through APIs
                    (Application
                    Programming Interfaces) and service marketplaces. This capability enables organizations to extend
                    their
                    applications with additional functionalities without significant development efforts.

                <p>
                <h2>What is the Front End of cloud architecture?</h2>
                Everything with which the end user interacts is part of the front-end infrastructure. The user interface
                is the result of integrating various sub-components, such as browsers, tablets, mobile devices, etc.
                With the help of the front end, the end user can connect to the cloud computing infrastructure. In
                short, “the front end is the end that the client interacts with.” </p>
                <p>

                <h2>What is the Back End of cloud architecture? </h2>
                The back end is everything the user does not usually see and everything that processes the data. The
                service provider uses the back end to manage all the resources required to provide cloud computing
                services, such as data storage, security mechanisms, virtual machines, deploying models, servers,
                traffic control mechanisms, and so on. In short, “the back end is the end that service provider
                interacts with.”</p>
                <h2>Components of cloud computing architecture </h2>
                There are various components of cloud architecture. Some of those components are:
                <p>
                    Client infrastructure: The client infrastructure component is a frontend component that provides a
                    graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with the cloud.</p>
                <p>Application: An application is any platform, such as an app or software, provided by a company
                    through which clients can access the cloud.</p>

                    Service: A cloud service manages the type of service a client uses based on his needs. There are
                    three types of services: SaaS (software as a service), PaaS (platform as a service), and IaaS
                    (infrastructure as a service).</p>
                <p>Runtime cloud: The runtime cloud offers virtual machine implementation and runtime environment. <br>
                    Storage: The cloud computing storage component provides storage space in the cloud for managing and
                    storing data. Cloud storage is of three types: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud. <br>
                    Infrastructure: The infrastructure component provides services on three levels: the host, the
                    application, and the network. It includes the software and hardware components required to support
                    the cloud computing model, such as storage network devices, servers, and other storage resources.
                    <br>
                    Management: The management component is in charge of managing backend components such as storage
                    services, applications, runtime cloud infrastructure, and security issues, as well as establishing
                    coordination. <br>
                    Security: Security is the backend component of cloud computing that ensures data security in the
                    cloud.
                    Internet: The internet is the medium through which the frontend and backend components communicate
                    and interact. </p>
